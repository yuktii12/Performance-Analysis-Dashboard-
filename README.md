Meta Ad Analysis Dashboard
This is a Meta Ad Performance Dashboard that tracks the effectiveness of ad campaigns
across key KPIs such as impressions, clicks, engagements, conversions, and budget. It
provides a complete funnel view—from awareness to engagement to purchases—along with
demographic, geographic, and time-based insights.
The dashboard shows consistent weekly engagement, but hourly trends peak in the
afternoon and evening hours. This suggests that ads should be scheduled and budget-
weighted towards those times to maximize ROI.
The calendar highlights certain days (19th–21st, 25th–27th) with spikes in engagement,
which could be linked to promotions or campaign launches. This indicates that event-based
campaigns drive higher performance.
-Made using Power BI and the steps are as follows:
1. Data Connection and Integration
2. Data Modeling and Transformation
3. Visualization and Reporting
